                        <p>More than two decades have passed since Sarah Connor
                            prevented Judgment Day, changed the future, and
                            re-wrote the fate of the human race. Dani Ramos is
                            living a simple life in Mexico City with her brother
                            and father when a highly advanced and deadly new
                            Terminator – a Rev-9 – travels back through time to
                            hunt and kill her. Dani's survival depends on her
                            joining forces with two warriors: Grace, an enhanced
                            super-soldier from the future, and a battle-hardened
                            Sarah Connor. As the Rev-9 ruthlessly destroys
                            everything and everyone in its path on the hunt for
                            Dani, the three are led to a T-800 from Sarah’s past
                            that may be their last best hope.</p>

                        <p>Simba idolises his father, King Mufasa, and takes to
                            heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the
                            kingdom celebrates the new cub's arrival. Scar,
                            Mufasa's brother—and former heir to the throne—has
                            plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is
                            ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately
                            resulting in Simba's exile. With help from a curious
                            pair of newfound friends, Simba will have to figure
                            out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully
                            his.</p>

                            and lawless outcast Shaw first faced off, they just
                            have swapped smacks and bad words. But when

                            ruthless actions threaten the future of humanity,
